###Hostel Specific Booking Engine###

Receive bookings the new way with an interactive calendar. The old method of selecting depart and arrive dates, which room and how many people simply doesnâ€™t work for hostel owners.

With a calendar display of the vacancies customers can see all available beds in every room without having to query the website, they can then create a booking across multiple rooms with multiple beds.

###Manage All Bookings From One Screen###

Our elegant and simple design creates a very intuitive user experience. The system can be understood in minutes and is fool proof to use.

Bookings are seen, confirmed and created in the same place so that when your staff are creating new bookings they can see them in context with all the other reservations.

This makes the system incredibly easy to use and removes potential confusion, even more importantly it eliminates the possibility of over-booking.
